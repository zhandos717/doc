# ID

Inherits [Hidden](/docs/{{version}}/fields/hidden).

\* has the same capabilities

The `ID` field is used for the `primary key`.  
Like the Hidden field, it is displayed only in the preview and does not appear in forms.

```php
use MoonShine\UI\Fields\ID;

ID::make()
```

If the `primary key` has a name that is different from `id`, you need to specify the arguments in the `make()` method.

```php
ID::make('ID', 'primary_key')
```
