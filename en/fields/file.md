## Basics

> [!TIP]
> Before using, ensure that a symbolic link is set up for the **storage** directory.
> `php artisan storage:link`

The _File_ field is used for file uploads and includes all basic methods.

~~~tabs
tab: Class
```php
use MoonShine\UI\Fields\File;

File::make('File')
```
tab: Blade
```blade
<x-moonshine::form.wrapper label="File">
    <x-moonshine::form.file
        name="file"

> [!NOTE]
> To correctly generate the file URL, you must set the environment variable `APP_URL` to match your application's URL.

<a name="disk"></a>
## Disk

The `disk()` method allows you to change the _filesystems disk_.

```php
disk(string $disk)
```

```php
File::make('File')
    ->disk('public')
```

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the _disk_ `public` is used. You can change it in the [configuration file](https://moonshine-laravel.com/docs/resource/getting-started/configuration).

> [!NOTE]
> When using the `local` driver, the returned `url` is not a valid URL. For this reason, we recommend always naming your files in a way that will create valid URLs.

<a name="dir"></a>
## Directory

By default, files will be saved in the root directory of the disk. The `dir()` method allows you to specify a directory for saving files relative to the root directory.

```php
dir(string $dir)
```

```php
File::make('File')
    ->dir('docs')
```

<a name="allowed-extensions"></a>
## Allowed Extensions

Using the `allowedExtensions()` method, you can specify which files are available for upload.

```php
allowedExtensions(array $allowedExtensions)
```

```php
File::make('File')
    ->allowedExtensions(['pdf', 'doc', 'txt'])
```

<a name="multiple"></a>
## Multiple Upload

To upload multiple files, use the `multiple()` method.

```php
multiple(Closure|bool|null $condition = null)
```

```php
File::make('File')
    ->multiple()
```

> [!ERROR]
> The field in the database must be of type _text_ or _json_.
> You also need to add type casting for the eloquent model - *json*, or *array*, or *collection*.

<a name="removable"></a>
## File Removal

To enable file removal, you need to use the `removable()` method.

```php
removable(
    Closure|bool|null $condition = null,
    array $attributes = []
)
```

- `$condition` - the condition for executing the method,
- `$attributes` - additional attributes for the button.

```php
File::make('File')
    ->removable()
```

> [!NOTE]
> The delete button will be available in the editing mode of the field.

> [!NOTE]
> When deleting a resource, the files are also deleted.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When mass deleting resource items, files are not deleted. You need to implement file deletion for mass resource item deletion yourself.

### Attributes

```php
File::make('File')
    ->removable(
        attributes: ['@click.prevent' => '$event.target.closest(`.x-removeable`).remove()']
    )
```

### disableDeleteFiles()

The `disableDeleteFiles()` method allows you to delete only the database record but not the actual file.

```php
disableDeleteFiles()
```

```php
File::make('File')
    ->removable()
    ->disableDeleteFiles()
```

### enableDeleteDir()

The `enableDeleteDir()` method deletes the directory specified in the `dir()` method if it is empty.

```php
enableDeleteDir()
```

```php
File::make('File')
    ->dir('docs')
    ->removable()
    ->enableDeleteDir()
```

<a name="download"></a>
## Disable Download

The `disableDownload()` method allows you to exclude the ability to download the file.

```php
disableDownload(Closure|bool|null $condition = null)
```

```php
File::make('File', 'file')
    ->disableDownload()
```

<a name="filename"></a>
## Original File Name

When uploading, a file name is generated by default. The `keepOriginalFileName()` method allows you to keep the original file name.

```php
keepOriginalFileName()
```

```php
File::make('File')
    ->keepOriginalFileName()
```

<a name="customname"></a>
## Custom File Name

The `customName()` method allows you to save a file with a custom name.

```php
customName(Closure $name)
```

```php
use Illuminate\Http\UploadedFile;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

File::make('File', 'file')
    ->customName(fn(UploadedFile $file, Field $field) =>  Str::random(10) . '.' . $file->extension())
```

<a name="names"></a>
## Element Names

The `names()` method allows you to change the displayed name without altering the file name.

```php 
names(Closure $closure)
```

- `$closure` - a closure that takes the file name and the file index as parameters.

```php
File::make('File', 'file')
    ->names(fn(string $filename, int $index = 0) => 'File ' . $index + 1)
```

<a name="item-attributes"></a>
## Element Attributes

The `itemAttributes()` method allows you to add additional attributes to the elements.

```php
itemAttributes(Closure $closure)
```

- `$closure` - a closure that takes the file name and the file index as parameters.

```php
File::make('File', 'file')
    ->itemAttributes(fn(string $filename, int $index = 0) => [
        'style' => 'width: 250px; height: 250px;'
    ])
```

<a name="helper-methods"></a>
## Helper Methods

### getRemainingValues()

The `getRemainingValues()` method allows you to get the values that remain in the form, taking into account deletions.

```php
getRemainingValues()
```

### removeExcludedFiles()

The `removeExcludedFiles()` method allows you to physically delete files during the process.

```php
removeExcludedFiles()
```
