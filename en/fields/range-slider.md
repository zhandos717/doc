## Basics

Inherits [Range](/docs/{{version}}/fields/range)

\* has the same capabilities.

The *RangeSlider* field is an extension of *Range* and additionally has the ability to change values using a slider.

<a name="make"></a>
## Creation

```php
use MoonShine\UI\Fields\RangeSlider;

RangeSlider::make('Age')
    ->fromTo('age_from', 'age_to')
```

<a name="filter"></a>
## Filter

When using the *RangeSlider* field to build a filter, the `fromTo()` method is not used, as filtering occurs by a single field in the database table.

```php
use MoonShine\UI\Fields\RangeSlider;

RangeSlider::make('Age', 'age')
```
