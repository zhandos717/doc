## What is MoonShine

`MoonShine` is an open-source package for projects on `Laravel` (license `MIT`), designed for accelerated development of web projects. It is perfect for creating:

- Admin panels
- `MVP` (minimum viable products)
- Backoffice applications
- Content management systems (`CMS`)

`MoonShine` provides developers with tools for quickly creating functional and user-friendly administrative interfaces, working as a "framework on framework" and extending the capabilities of `Laravel`.

## Who is it for

`MoonShine` is designed with the needs of developers of various skill levels in mind:

- **Beginners**: A low entry threshold allows for easy implementation of basic tasks such as authentication and `CRUD` operations.

> [!NOTE]
> To effectively use `MoonShine`, a basic understanding of `Laravel` is necessary. If you are a beginner, it is recommended to master the fundamentals of `Laravel` first.

- **Professionals**: The ability to use all the features of `Laravel` without restrictions while gaining tools for speeding up development.

## Name history

The name "`MoonShine`" has an interesting origin. It refers not so much to "moonlight" as to the process of making drinks independently in illegal conditions under the cover of night. It is a metaphor for the process of developing an admin panel: creating a quality product "with soul" in one's free time, mainly at night, initially for personal use and for friends.
